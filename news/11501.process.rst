Emit an error to prevent the ``pkg_resources`` metadata backend from being used
on Python 3.12 or later. This backend exists for backward compatibility, and
should only be used on newer Python versions by Python distributors that cannot
correctly implement ``importlib.metadata`` support in a timely fashion. Time is
up for transition since CPython is now removing mechanisms that ``pkg_resource``
relies on, and the backend will no longer work on Python 3.12 or later.
